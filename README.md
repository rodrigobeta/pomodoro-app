# Pomodoro App

Welcome to my final project for the Codedex Basic JavaScript course!

## Project Description

This is a simple Pomodoro timer web application designed to help users manage their study or work time more efficiently. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Main Features:
- **Session Timer:** Defaults to 25 minutes.
- **Start/Pause Functionality:** Allows starting and pausing the timer at any moment.
- **Reset Functionality:** Resets the timer to its initial state (25:00).
- **Sound Notification:** Plays a bell sound when the timer reaches zero.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Clean and user-friendly design.

## Project Context

This project was developed as the **final project** for the **Basic JavaScript** course on the **Codedex** platform. Its main goal is to demonstrate the understanding and application of fundamental JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, event handling, and timer logic.

## Demonstration

You can see a brief demonstration of the application in action in the following video:
